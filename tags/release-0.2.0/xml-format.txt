This should document the XML format saved by the application (like
a poor man's DTD). This is incompatible with versions previous
to 0.2.0:


Node: frequent-task-reminder (mandatory)

 Root of the configuration. Anything outside of this should be
 ignored.

 Attributes: None.

 Children: configuration-list, task-list.
 

Node: configuration-list

 List of configuration options for the program.

 Attributes: None.

 Children: ?
 

Node: task-list

 List of tasks the user has scheduled. Can be empty.

 Attributes: None.

 Children: task.


Node: task

 Individual task node. This is really a container

 Attributes: None.

 Chilren: id, name, starting-day, note, last-unit


Node: id (mandatory)

 Numeric positive integer specifying the id of the task.

 Attributes: None.

 Children: None.
 

Node: name (mandatory)

 User specified block of text.

 Attributes: None.

 Children: None.
 

Node: starting-day (mandatory)

 UTC day when the work units start being counted. Format of the
 date string is YYYY-MM-DD.

 Attributes: None.

 Children: None.


Node: note

 Optional user specified block of text for the task.

 Attributes: None.

 Children: None.


Node: last-unit (mandatory)

 UTC day of the last performed unit. Same format as
 starting-day. Note the attribute "amount" to know exactly if the
 specified day is over or not. The "amount" attribute is an integer
 from zero to +infinite. This attribute specifies how many work
 units have been done the specified day.

 The attribute is necessary to know if a recently started task has
 had its work units done. If the starting-day and last-unit dates
 are equal, and the attribute is zero, no work units have been
 done. On the other hand, if the attribute is one, the meaning is
 equal to having a last-unit date of starting-day plus one, with
 an attribute of zero. The following two are equivalent:

  <starting-day>2005-06-17</starting-day>
  <last-unit amount="1">2005-06-17</last-unit>

  <starting-day>2005-06-17</starting-day>
  <last-unit amount="0">2005-06-18</last-unit>
