Right now... there is no install!

Sorry. This program is still too contained in a single file to have
a proper installation. In fact, the only things you really need are
Python (http://www.python.org/) and the ElementTree Python package
used for XML (http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm).

So, install Python, install ElementTree (comes with a setup.py you
can run) and then just run this script from wherever you like. You
might want to copy this file to your ~/bin (or /usr/local/bin if
you have more than one user).

Correct installation procedures are planned after the split of this
script into a logical module with external interfaces (commandline
and GUI).
