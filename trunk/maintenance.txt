How to make a release:

 1) Bump human version inside frequent-task-reminder.py.

 2) Commit.

 3) Annotate revision number and create tag:

  svn copy -r revision_number \
        svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/ftr/trunk \
        svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/ftr/tags/release-x.y.z \
        -m "Release x.y.z."
